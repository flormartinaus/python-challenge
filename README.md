# Python Projects

These two projects demonstrate the skills I gained from the Python modules at the bootcamp. In the first challenge, I am writing a Python script to analyse a company's financial records. In the second, I'm writing a script to assist a small, rural community in the United States with modernising its voting system.

The ability to set up an organised and consistent way to structure the scripts, following the same logic for both, first importing csv files, setting variables to work with, reading, storing, and calculating results, and being able to write results to output file and print at the same time, has been the most valuable takeaway from these projects.
